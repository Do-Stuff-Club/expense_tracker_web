This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install all required packages:

```bash
yarn install
```

Next, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

The test login is:

- Username: potato@potato.com
- Password: asdfasdf

Currently a user can create and edit "categories," which are groups of "tags." The information will be automatically persisted on the test server https://expense-tracker-test-api.herokuapp.com/
